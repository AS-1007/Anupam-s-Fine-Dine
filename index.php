    <h1>Anupam's Philosophy For Fine Dining</h1>
    <p class="text-center ">It's just like watching a performance in a theatre: you take your seat, wait for the show to begin and enjoy the experience. During the dinner, all the ingredients are chosen and prepared by the chef himself right then and there, in front of you. It is a leap of faith into his talent, and you expect to end up with a memorable dining experience.

Everyone who has visited an AS restaurant knows very well how it feels: it is a tacit agreement, a vote of confidence that is made the exact moment you cross the door. AS is predicated on the relationship between guest and chef where complete trust is placed on the chef's faculties in interpreting what is best for the guest as well as the seasonal produce and local availability.</p>
